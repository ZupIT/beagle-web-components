Feature: PageView Component Validation

  As a Beagle developer/user
  I'd like to make sure my pageView component works as expected
  In order to guarantee that my application never fails

  Background:
    Given that I'm on the pageview screen

  Scenario: PageView 01 - PageView component renders text attribute correctly
    Then my pageview components should render their respective pages attributes correctly
