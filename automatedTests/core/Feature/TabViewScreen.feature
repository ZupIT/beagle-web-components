Feature: TabView Component Validation

  As a Beagle developer/user
  I'd like to make sure my tabView component works as expected
  In order to guarantee that my application never fails

  Background:
    Given that I'm on the tabview screen

  Scenario: TabView 01 - TabView component renders text attribute correctly
    Then my tabview components should render their respective tabs attributes correctly



#  Scenario Outline: TabView 02 - Tabs render all text attribute correctly
#    When I click on text <text1>
#    Then my tab should render the text <text2> and <text3> correctly
#
#    Examples:
#      | text1 | text2            | text3                      |
#      |TAB 1  | Welcome to Tab 1 | This is Tab1's second text |
#      |TAB 2  | Welcome to Tab 2 | This is Tab2's second text |
#      |TAB 3  | Welcome to Tab 3 | This is Tab3's second text |
#      |TAB 4  | Welcome to Tab 4 | This is Tab4's second text |
