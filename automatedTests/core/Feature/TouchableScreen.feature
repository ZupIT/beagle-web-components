Feature: Touchable Component Validation

  As a Beagle developer/user
  I'd like to make sure my touchable component works as expected
  In order to guarantee that my application never fails

  Background:
    Given that I'm on the touchable screen

  Scenario: Touchable 01 - Touchable component renders text attribute correctly
    Then touchable screen should render all text attributes correctly

  Scenario: Touchable 02 - Touchable component performs action click on text correctly
    And I have a text with touchable configured
    When I click on touchable text Click here!
    Then touchable component should render the action attribute correctly

#  Scenario: Touchable 03 - Touchable component performs action click on image correctly
#    And I have an image with touchable configured
#    When I click on touchable image
#    Then component should render the action attribute correctly
